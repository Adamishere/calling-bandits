# Simulate Call Center Response Rates - Using Dynamic "Bandits" Call allocation 
Using adaptive sampling or "bandit" algorithms to maximize response rates. It utilized a randomized "search-exploit" algorithm. This simulation seeks to test the optimal hyper parameters in terms of searching and exploiting across several conditions.
